I am a **Lead Software Engineer** with 4 years of experience architecting high-availability systems and optimizing backend performance for global platforms. Currently, I am pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech** (GPA 4.0), specializing in modernizing legacy infrastructure, scalable cloud architecture, and machine learning.

Most recently, at **Ridecell**, I led global on-site platform launches and reduced dashboard creation time by **60%** using AI-driven automation. I also reduced API latency by **75%** and maintained **99.999%** uptime for critical systems.

My technical toolkit includes **Python, Django, C/C++, Java, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes**, and modern AI/ML frameworks like **LangChain** and **Anthropic Claude**. I am passionate about building accessible technology (winner of MLH Hack-cessible) and contributing to open source projects like **Weblate**.
